in the quiet moments when the world fades away you will hear a whisper in your heart it is the voice of love calling you home to a place beyond the stars where souls unite in an endless dance of light and shadow here there is no pain no sorrow only the purest joy the joy of being whole of being loved without condition without end in this place time is a river flowing gently through fields of dreams every moment is eternal every breath a new beginning and as you move through this sacred space you will know that you are never alone for love is always with you guiding you holding you lifting you higher into the infinite embrace of the divine here you will find the answers to all your questions the peace you have longed for the love you have sought and in this love you will be reborn not as you were but as you were always meant to be a being of light and love radiant and free

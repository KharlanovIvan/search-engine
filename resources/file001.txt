when you think you are alone remember love and the warmth of the sun on your skin the gentle breeze in the trees these are signs you are never truly alone but watched over guided by hands unseen love endures beyond the veil that separates life and death it reaches through the mist of uncertainty and fear offering hope even in the darkest moments for love is the strongest force in the universe it binds us to each other to the earth to the stars to the very essence of life itself and in that love we find solace comfort and peace do not fear the unknown embrace it as part of the journey knowing that the love you carry will light your way through the shadows of doubt and despair and lead you to the place where dreams live where all is possible and nothing is lost only transformed into something more beautiful more enduring more real than anything you have ever known this is the promise of love this is the promise of life this is the promise of eternity

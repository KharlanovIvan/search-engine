as you journey through life remember that every step you take is a step toward the light even in your darkest hours when all seems lost there is a path that leads you forward it is the path of love of hope of faith this path may be narrow it may be steep but it is always there waiting for you to find it and when you do you will discover that you are not walking alone for there are others with you unseen but always present guiding you with their love their wisdom their strength they are the ones who came before who have walked this path and now walk beside you through the veil of time and space they are the voices in the wind the stars in the night sky the beating of your own heart they are a part of you and you are a part of them forever connected by the bonds of love and when you reach the end of your journey you will not find an end at all but a new beginning a new adventure in the vastness of eternity
